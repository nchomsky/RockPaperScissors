# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with multiplayer functionality.

Try it out [here](https://rock-paper-scissors-nc.herokuapp.com/)!

## Built Using:
* JavaScript
* Socket.io
* Node.Js
* Express
* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges Encountered
* Having trouble with allowing players to play again in multiplayer.
  * For now the game works, so I want to shift my focus onto other projects
* Initially figuring out how socket.io communicated between client side and server side
  * I began really understanding it at the very end and it makes a lot more sense to me now then at the beginning

## Future Plans and Ideas
* Allow players to play again in Multiplayer
* Add rooms to choose from
* Maybe add a chat functionality
